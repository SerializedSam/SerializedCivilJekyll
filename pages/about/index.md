# About

{% newthought 'Serialized Civil is a blog'%} about civil and structural engineering. 

I go by Sam. This is a place for me to share what I'm learning about, practicing, and improving on with a wider audience. 

Some of the things I'm interestd in are the stories of engineers whose work we're building on, investigations into the history of provisions in design codes and manuals, and improving the readability, usability, and check-ability of calculations.
